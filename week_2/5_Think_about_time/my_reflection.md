# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

* I ran into some trouble with time management at the very beginning of Phase 0 due to some personal issues, so I had to play a little catch-up at first, but now I feel like I'm on the same page with the majority of other students. The biggest challenge would be to maintain good steady learning pace, dedicating at least 5-6 hours to studying every day, and avoiding to fall back into the hole.
* I will make sure to explore the curriculum closely at the beginning of each week and then plan my days accordingly so that I'm able to get everything done on time. In case, there are any concepts that are more difficult to understand I will give myself some extra time for those as well. Also, I am planning to maintain a fine balance between studying and physical activity/exercise as I feel like it is very important, especially during the times of stress and excess of sedentary work (both of which can take place during Phase 0).
* I might do some meditating - something I've never done before but been meaning to try, especially after some of my friends and relative recommended it. Most importantly, I will be relying on the support of my family, which so far, has done a tremendous job of helping me through the preparation phase. I want to take this energy and channel it into my studying process.
* Taking it one step a time in order to solidify the material presented in each challenge and not becoming stressed out about what's still ahead of me. As long as I'm able to manage my time wisely and maintain a healthy state of mind, I have no reason to doubt my success in the future.
