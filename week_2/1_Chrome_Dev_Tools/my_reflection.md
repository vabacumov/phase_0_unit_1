# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* Document Object Model gives a clear view of what processes take place inside a webpage or an application, how objects interact with each other. I can say that I understood most of the information presented about DOM and it seems like a really useful invention. I'm not really sure if I can't point out any negative aspects.
* Obviously, wordpress.com webpage is much more complex than my own. There are a ton of different elements, including a lot of scripts and meta data despite the fact that on the outside the website looks quite simple.
* I found it extremely helpful and I definitely had some fun exploring it. It was very easy to learn, especially with the help of the instruction videos. Some things I was able to discover by myself just intuitively.
* Yes, like I just mentioned above, I was able to figure out some functions of the Chrome Web Tools by myself and it was very satisfying.
* I didn't use any additional resources aside from the ones that were presented.
