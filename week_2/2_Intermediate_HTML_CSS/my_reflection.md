# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* I think that web standrads is a great thing and an important one. Without it, it would be hard for web developers to work. It's sort of like like the driving rules in a sense.
* The standard structure is very clear and makes a lot of sense. It easy to understand as something that is a universal template.
* Definitely like them, at least because it saves time and extra work of giving "div" specific "ids" and "classes".
* Reset.css is necessary to give the web developers a peace of mind knowing that the webpages they create will look exactly how they want them to look regardless of what browser they are being viewed on.
* I always use Chrome, and I opened a few pages in Internet Explorer, just to see the difference. It's obvious that some pages look differently in different browsers. In my opinion, that's a bad thing that only makes web developers do extra work, but I can see how some might view this as a good thing because of the diversity that it provides.
* I used http://www.cssreset.com/ to better understand what CSS reset is, also used http://www.w3schools.com/ for certain technical questions regarding header links and @fontface as the links provided for learning about this challenge both weren't working.
