# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://vabacumov.github.io/

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* First of all, I learned what user experience is exactly as before this challenge, I could only guess the what the definition encompasses. Now I know what design and user experience is all about, what role it plays in creating/maintaining a website, how it can be improved, etc. The thing that stood out the most was that it's really hard or even impossibe to measure user experience from a statistical point of view; it is a very subjective topic.
* I'm going to admit that I'm not a big fan of design, although I did find it kind of exciting that I could tweak certain parts of my webpage to make it look the way I like; I guess I could say that I gradually became really involved in the process despite the fact that in the beginnig it appeared quite boring to me. Overall, it was definitely useful in terms of learning certain skills and a bit of fun at the same time.
* My first step was to create a wireframe for my page. For this purpose I used "Mockingbird" and pen/paper simultaneously. It worked great, I was able to visualize my website's skeleton before getting to the actual code, which made it a lot easier to build it than in the previous times. More or less, I managed to create what I was looking for, maybe with a few small exceptions.
* I would like to make the website more complicated in the future, and for that I'm going to need the knowledge that I feel I probably don't have just yet. Specifically, I would add more elements and make the page more animated and engaging for the user.
* It was not that difficult to apply the concepts that I already knew, on the other hand, what I didn't know complicated my task a bit. What I thought was really cool is embedding a map with a specific location zoomed in into my website. Even though, I only copied the necessary script from Google, I'm planning to understand this underlying piece of code better as we progress to JavaScript and so on. Embedding a Youtube video was also fun.
* I mostly just Googled whatever questions I had. As mentioned above, I had to find out how to embed a map. Other than that, I used "Mockingbird" for the wireframing, W3Schools for looking up certain element tags and color codes.
