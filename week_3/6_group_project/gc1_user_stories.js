/*  // My role in the group is: Person 1: User Stories

// Here is my part of the challenge: 1) As a store manager, I would like to have a program for my
register that would allow me to take any given receipt and add up the  dollar amout of all purchases
made on that receipt and give me the total sum.

2) As a store manager, I would like to have a program for my register that would allow me to take a
single receipt and find out what the average (mean) cost of purchases made on that receipt is.

3) As a school teacher, I would like to have a program that would be able to intake the list of my
students' grades (listed in alphabetical order)  and give me the grade that represents a point
dividing the upper and lower halves of the class.

// My Reflection This was our first group project, and I had to start it off, so I was definitely somewhat nervous.
// Luckily, I was able to pair up with another person from our group and think about how to approach this assignment in
// the best way possible. This gave me a lot of confidence as I understood the instructions and the whole process much
// more clear. Once I knew what needed to be done, it wasnt' too hard to proceed from that point on. Also, I'd like to
// say that despite the fact that as Person 1 in the group I didn't have to write actual code this time, I still took
// time to think how I would attempt to write the required code and analyzed the final code given to me in details
// before running it through the tests. As far as technical knowledge, one thing I picked up from this challenge was the
// proper JS syntax on how to sort an array either numerically or alphabetically in an ascending or descending order.
// This will certainly be helpful in the future. Overall, I feel like our group did a great job. Everyone has completed
// their part of the assignment in time, our efforts were well coordinated and the communication was good. Finally, the
// code passed all the tests successfully, which was great news! I really enjoyed working on this project.
