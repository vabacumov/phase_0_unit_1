// My role in the group is:
Person 1: User Stories
// Here is my part of the challenge:
1) As a store manager, I would like to have a program for my register
that would allow me to take any given receipt and add up the 
dollar amout of all purchases made on that receipt and give me the
total sum.

2) As a store manager, I would like to have a program for my register
that would allow me to take a single receipt and find out what the
average (mean) cost of purchases made on that receipt is.

3) As a school teacher, I would like to have a program that would be
able to intake the list of my students' grades (listed in alphabetical order) 
and give me the grade that represents a point dividing the upper and lower
halves of the class.
