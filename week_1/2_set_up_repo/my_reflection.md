## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* Creating a repository on GitHub is pretty straight-forward, you just have to sing in to your GitHub account, and under the repositories tab, select "Create New". In order to clone the newly created repository to your locacl machine, you have to open git, type the name of your repo in the search box and the click the "Clone" button.
* An open source means that the project, the specific framework code for a software is readily available for anyone out there who wants to see it and also edit it, make changes without having to ask the original developer for the persmission to do so.
* Open Source seems like a great idea and represents a huge potential for improvement for any given software using the collaborative effort of many developers willing to contribute their share towards the common project. The only downside I can see here is the lack of ability to earn money from such projects, although I realize that certain companies have come up with ways to use Open Source to their benefit, including monetary.
* Licensing is an important aspect when it comes to releasing your work out in the open. Since there are many different types of licenses available, even for the Open Source projects, one has to be familiar with them in order to be able to choose the right one, as it will affect what others can do with the project and what potential rights you are relinquishing as the original developer.
* I can't say that I've struggled with this challenge, but it was certainly important to further my knowledge about Open Source and what types of it are out there right now.
