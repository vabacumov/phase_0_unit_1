## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* A lot of things make sense about HTML, although it's hard to pinpoint every single one. The fundamentals are rather clear to me, however, I did feel overwhelmed at times when creating my personal website, most likely because it takes a lot of time to memorize the entire HTML glossary, which is comes in very handy when you want to fix a specific element.
* The good thing about HTML is that it's quite simple to learn and use. Since HTML is an essential part of virtually any website, it's an important concenpt to be mastered. I guess, the bad thing about it would be the volume of each HTML document that is needed to create a website, as it's pretty easy to get lost along the way.
* I certainly had "aha" moments with this challenge, specifically when I was able to edit my HTML or CSS document in such a way that the visible changes on the website could instantly be observed through the browser. It was a satisfying feeling!
* I did refer to Codeacademy a few times, as it's a website that I've used in the past for learning HTML and CSS.
