## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

* Setting up git and GitHub was relatively easy, no major complaints here. I actually already had an existing account on GitHub from last year when I was experementing with it. However, I did not know nearly as much about what git and GitHub are as I know now after reading this section.
* Git and GitHub in my understanding essentially serve the same purpose - the ability to edit and save/keep track of changes made to specific files, code made by different people that can be located anywhere in the world, but git is a local app that's installed on everyone's machine, whereas GitHub is a website, sort of like a cloud to perform the functions named above on the Internet.
* Version control is a mechanism through which all changes made to a file are stored and updated in such a way that you can always see what changes were made, when they were made, by whom they were made (in case multiple people are working on the file) and, if necessary, revert back to the previous version of the file. GitHub makes it possible to do all of that online.
* Obviously, git is an extremely convenient tool for developers to use, as an alternative to, let's say, storing all changes on a USB stick and sending back and forth to each other, or even constantly emailing each other updated copies of the file. It's quite clear to me why it's an irreplacable tool these days.
* So far, with git and GitHub everything makes perfect sense. I will have to see, however, if I'm able to grasp all the little details later on.
