## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

* I was able to comprehend the process, which professional web designers use in order to undertake the project of planning and structuring big websites step-by-step. It tunrs out that it's not that much different from the process that engineers and architects use.
* I can't really say that I like or enjoy design too much, but I still understand the importance of it, and therefore, it was fun to perform a challenge like this one.
* I used all of the resources that were presented to me on GitHub. As far as asking questions, I just tried to get inside the mind of whoever was responsible for creating the websites, for which I drew blueprints.
* No real trouble, but I sort of had to guess what was really needed to complete this challenge. I hope I did the right thing.
* Certainly learned how to break down a project of building a website into smaller pieces and where to begin.
* Again, I can say that I feel pretty confident, but still, perhaps, not 100% yet.
* Drawing the blueprint and trying to analyze the structure of the existing websites was fun.
* Learning about very specific design trick was somewhat boring as it is not something that I ever imagine myself doing (although, you never know...)
