## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


* Most importantly I learned what makes up the difference between the terms "Internet" and "Web". I also learned a lot of new concepts regarding DNS, of which I only had shallow knowledge before
* In order to set up and HTML site you have to remember to add the file containing the code for the webpage to your repository and then commit the change through GitHub (or GitHub app) specifying what specific changes you've made in the Commit message
* It was an exciting feeling, I was hoping everything would be working fine, and it was!
* I sort of already knew some of the information about how the web functions, so I did have a few "aha" moments there. I specifically tried to solidify my knowledge of the basig git commands, as I had a feeling that it will come in very useful later on
