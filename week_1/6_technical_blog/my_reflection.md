## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Blog url: http://vabacumov.github.io/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I certainly enjoyed the process of picking out and describing my 3 favorite websites. It was and engaging and stimulating process. However, I did run into trouble when playing around with CSS positioning once again... At first, I had an idea of insterting iframes with the three websites on the left side of the page and adding text on the right, but for some reason this didn't work out at all, so I was forced to simplify my webpage radically just to make it work. It was a bit disappointing, but overall, I'm still satisfied with this challenge.
