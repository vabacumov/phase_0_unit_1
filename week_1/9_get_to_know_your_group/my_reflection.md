"Hey group! Nice to meet everyone here!

My name is Vlad. I currently reside in Concord, CA (it's about 30 minutes away from SF). Obviously, it's not easy to pinpoint the 3 favorite websites, but anyways, I'll go with vk.com (my soical networking of choice), eurosport.ru (my sports news resource) and wikipedia.org, since I certainly spend a lot of time there. My thinking style was identified as "Abstract Sequential" and learning style as "Multimodal" (I hope that's correct xD).

Look forwarding to working with all of you! I believe we're the only group that's got 5 people, so that's kinda nice! Good luck and have fun in the learning process!

Best regards, Vlad Abacumov."

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

I certainly felt and still feel somewhat intimidated and overwhelmed with the amount of new information to digest, but seeing how other people might feel the same way made me relax a bit more since I know I'm not alone out there! Also, looking at what some students (probably more advanced/experienced) have come up with for their website and blog challenges and comparing it to mine, made me a little frustrated as I realize that I can't keep up at that level yet. However, I will work hard to get there and I'm sure that's definitely something within my reach!
